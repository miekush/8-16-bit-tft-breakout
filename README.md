Breakout Boards for 8 and 16 Bit Parallel TFTs with Direct Solder Flex PCB Connection

I designed these breakout to test several of the direct solder to pcb TFTs I have seen on sites like AliExpress.
These displays use a flex pcb designed to be soldered directly to your application pcb, unlike other displays that require a FFC connector.

How to Assemble?
  1) Clean the breakout pcb of any debris using a cotton ball and ipa.
  2) Remove the film on the top of the adhesive and attach the flex pcb to the breakout on the location indicated in the silkscreen.
  3) Apply a liberal amount of flux to the tft flex pcb and the pads of the breakout board.
  4) Using a pre-tinned soldering iron, drag the tip across the breakout pads to solder the connector.
  5) Clean solder joints with ipa and use double sided tape to mount tft to pcb.
